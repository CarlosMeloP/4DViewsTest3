**4DViewsTest3** is a Unity project where I'm trying several VFX ideas with
[4DViews] volumetric videos and the [realtime ray tracing features] (DXR) of
Unity [HDRP].

[4DViews]: https://www.4dviews.com/
[realtime ray tracing features]:
  https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@8.2/manual/Ray-Tracing-Getting-Started.html
[HDRP]:
  https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/

The volumetric video data files are missing from this repository. You can
download them from the [Resources page] of the 4DViews site.

You have to convert the texture files into a [HAP] encoded .mov file. Use
[ffmpeg.sh] for the conversion.

[HAP]: https://hap.video/
[ffmpeg.sh]: /ffmpeg.sh
